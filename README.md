# IATI-HXL Correlation Table

**IATI** is an open data sharing standard and framework used by humanitarian organizations and donors to report aid activities, transactions and results. While the **Humanitarian Exchange Language** or **HXL** is a type of labeling system. Humanitarian organizations can use HXL to add standardized social media style hashtags to their database information fields making organizational spreadsheets using different heading taxonomy comparable.

This microproject will undertake to create a [correlation table](https://github.com/Humanitarian-AI/IATI-HXL/blob/master/IATI-HXL-Correlation.csv) linking IATI elements and attributes with HXL hashtags. The table will help humanitarian actors and AI researchers and developers work together to develop AI friendly elements and attributes for data and databases and tags to use to annotate text and queries.

## Resources

* IATI [elements and attributes](http://reference.iatistandard.org/203/activity-standard/summary-table/)
* HXL [website](http://hxlstandard.org)

## Correlation Table

After generating proposed IATI and HXL fields/hashtags, the project will attempt to generate JSON and Neo4j compatible versions of the fields.
